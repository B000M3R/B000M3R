# Hi there! 👋 

I'm John, and I’m deeply passionate about **service management**, not just as a job, but as a way to make a real difference. For me, it’s all about the **customer’s felt experience**, how they interact with services, how they’re supported, and how we can elevate good to exceptional. Over the years, I’ve dedicated myself to building and refining service management systems that deliver outstanding value and create seamless, reliable experiences. 🚀

From owning and managing ITSM systems to fine tuning Service Management routines, I’ve witnessed how the right approach can transform delivery, empower teams, and keep customers smiling. I believe that if the goal is to create value for the business through services, then the service management system for creating that value should be the starting point for all Service Management architecture. My mission? To craft service management systems that don’t just work, but are consistently improved and reliably deliver.
